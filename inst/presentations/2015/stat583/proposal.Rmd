# The TAG Project

## What is TAG?

* Web service/GUI.
* Basic text processing and mining.
* Serving HASS comunities.
* Designed for portability: laptop, supercomputers, and the cloud.


## Computing in HASS

* Like GUI's, tolerate web services.
* Typically not programmers.
* Don't want this:

```r
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::content_transformer(base::tolower))
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::removePunctuation)
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::removeNumbers)
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::stripWhitespace)
corpus <- tm::tm_map(corpus, tm::removeWords, tm::stopwords("english"))
tdm <- tm::TermDocumentMatrix(corpus)
wordcount_table <- sort(rowSums(as.matrix(tdm)), decreasing=TRUE)
```

# Proposed Project

## Two Elements

1. Fix the script capturer.
2. Demonstrate features in a complete workflow.

## Script Capturer

\end{center}

## Script Capturer

Who cares?

* Very important feature!
* Adds reliability, ability to make quick changes, work in batch...

Have:

* Uses regular expressions.
* Highly non-regular language...

Want:

* A proper parser.

## Script Capturer: Challenges and Novelty

Challenge: 

* Need C for reasonable performance.
* Basically has to be entirely custom.

That said...

* Inputs are well-defined and well-understood.
* I have lots of experience with C.


## Complete Workflow Demonstration(s)

* Demonstrate capabilities of TAG.
* Written for and of interest to target audience (HASS).
* Relevant to a forthcoming paper...

## Demonstration Possibilities

Challenge:

* Keeping it interesting, but also basic enough for intended audience.
* In HASS, a wordcloud is a paper!

Plan:

* Recreate examples from *Text Analysis with R for Students of Literature*.
* Go beyond...
* Stretch goal:  stylometric analysis, *Wizard of Oz* books. (hash table)



# Current Status

## Status

* Script capturer:  haven't started.
* Workflow:  mostly done.
* Stretch goal: thought hard about it...



## Thanks!
