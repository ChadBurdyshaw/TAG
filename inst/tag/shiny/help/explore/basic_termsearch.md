## Search

The search feature works in 3 separate ways:

* Specify a word and get counts and percentage of text.
* Specify a lower and upper count and get all words occurring at least as many times as the min count and no more than the max count.
* Specify lower and upper frequencies (percentage of the text) and all words that make up that amount of the tex will be shown.


By default, the search by term is exact.  If you select the "Find closest match"
option, then the word with smallest
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" target="_blank">Levenshtein distance</a>
is chosen in its place.
