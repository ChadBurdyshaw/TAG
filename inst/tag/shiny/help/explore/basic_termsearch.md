## Search

The search feature works in 3 separate ways.  You can specify:

* a word and get occurrence counts for that word.
* min/max counts and get a table of all words occurring in the text within that frequency range.
* min/max percentages and get a table of all words comprising a percentage of the text falling within the specified range.


By default, the search by term is exact.  If you select the "Find closest match"
option, then the word with smallest
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance" target="_blank">Levenshtein distance</a>
is chosen in its place.
