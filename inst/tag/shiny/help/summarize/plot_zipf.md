> Zipf Plot

[Zipf's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law)
says that the frequency of a word's occurrence in a text is 
inversely proportional to its rank in a frequency table.

The Zipf plot from the tm package plots the logarithm of the
frequency against the logarithm of the rank, and evaluates the
goodness of fit of a linear model.
