## Filtering and Excluding

#### Stopwords

"Stopwords" are words in a natural language that need to be filtered
out of the corpus before text mining.  There is no hard rule as to
what is and is not a stopword, and they can be context dependent.
Some examples that people generally agree are stopwords are
prepositions and indefinite articles.

For example, if the analyst is interested in finding words that are
frequently used together in an English language corpus, they may
well find that "the" has the highest correlation with the word of
interest.  This would be a true but useless fact, and removing
English stopwords from the corpus first would make the analyst's job
much easier.
