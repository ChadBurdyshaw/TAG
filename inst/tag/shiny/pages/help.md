# TAG Help System

The Text Analytics Gateway (TAG) is a web-app that contains a
collection of utilities for performing text analyses.

In addition to this help system, each analysis element contains this
icon:
<i title='Help' class='glyphicon glyphicon-question-sign'></i>.
If you click it, additional information and help will pop up on your
current page.
